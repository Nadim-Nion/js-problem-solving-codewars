# Problem Solving with JavaScript on CodeWars

```markdown

I have started my journey of **problem-solving with JavaScript** on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com). This repository will serve as a place to track my progress, store solutions, and document my learning experience as I solve challenges of varying difficulty.

## Repository Structure

- `easy/` - Beginner-level challenges
- `medium/` - Intermediate-level challenges
- `hard/` - Advanced-level challenges

Each folder will contain JavaScript files with solutions to specific challenges, along with brief problem descriptions and test cases.

## How to Run the Solutions

Make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your system. You can run any solution file by navigating to the appropriate folder and executing it with:

```bash
node easy/solution1.js
```
